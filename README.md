> This library was created with the intention of assisting C# developers to better design their code, such that nulls, null reference exceptions and unhandled exceptions are a rare occurrence. For you as a developer to achieve this, you need to change the way you model missing data and error conditions in your code.

### Get started
* Install the [Code Contracts](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970) extension for Visual Studio.
* Read the [introduction to Fortis](http://huwman.github.io/Fortis/2015/07/24/introduction.html)
